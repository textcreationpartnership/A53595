            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>I do not bid the ſtrive with witches Charmes,</l>
                  <l>Or ſuch unholy acts, to ceaſe thy harmes:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ceres</hi> herſelf, who all theſe things did know,</l>
                  <l>Had never power to cure her own love ſo:</l>
                  <l>No, take this Medicine (which of all is ſure)</l>
                  <l>Labour and abſence is thy only Cure,</l>
                  <l>But if the Fates compel thee, in ſuch faſhion,</l>
                  <l>That thou muſt needs live near her habitation,</l>
                  <l>And canſt not fly her ſight, learn here of me,</l>
                  <l>That thou would'ſt faine, and canſt not yet be free,</l>
                  <l>Set all thy Miſtriſs faults before thine eyes,</l>
                  <l>And all thy own diſgraces well adviſe;</l>
                  <l>Say to thy ſelf, that ſhe is coveteous.</l>
                  <l>Hath ta'ne my gifts, and us'd me thus, and thus;</l>
                  <l>Thus hath ſhe ſworne to me, and thus deceived;</l>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61669:45"/>
                  <l>Thus have I hope, and thus have been bereaved:</l>
                  <l>With love ſhe feeds my rival, while I ſtarve,</l>
                  <l>And poures on him kiſſes, which I deſerve:</l>
                  <l>She follows him with ſmiles, and gives to me</l>
                  <l>Sad looks, no Lovers, but a ſtrangers fee.</l>
                  <l>All thoſe Embraces I ſo oft deſired,</l>
                  <l>To him ſhe offers daily unrequired:</l>
                  <l>Whoſe whole deſert, and half mine weigh'd together.</l>
                  <l>Would make mine lead, and his ſeem cork and feather?</l>
                  <l>Then let her go, and ſince ſhe proves ſo hard,</l>
                  <l>Regard thy ſelf, and give her no regard.</l>
                  <l>Thus muſt thou ſchool thy ſelf, and I could wiſh</l>
                  <l>Thee to thy ſelf, moſt eloquent in this.</l>
                  <l>But put on greif enough and do not fear,</l>
                  <l>Grief will enforce thy eloquence t'appear.</l>
                  <l>Thus I my ſelf the love did once expell</l>
                  <l>Of one whoſe coyneſs vex'd my ſoule like hell</l>
                  <l>I muſt confeſs ſhe touch't me to the quick,</l>
                  <l>And I, that am Phyſitian, then was ſick.</l>
                  <l>But this I found to profit, I did ſtill</l>
                  <l>Ruminate what I thought in her was ill;</l>
                  <l>And, for to cure my ſelf, I found away,</l>
                  <l>Some honeſt ſlanders on her for to lay:</l>
                  <l>Quoth I how lamely doth my Miſtris go:</l>
                  <l>(Although, I muſt confeſs, it was not ſo;)</l>
                  <l>I ſaid, her armes was crooked, fingers bent,</l>
                  <l>Her ſhoulders bow'd, her legs conſum'd and ſpent:</l>
                  <l>Her colour ſad, her neck as dark as night.</l>
                  <l>(When <hi>Venus</hi> might in all have tane delight)</l>
                  <l>But yet becauſe I would no more come nigh her,</l>
                  <l>My ſelf unto my ſelf did thus bely her.</l>
                  <l>Do thou the like, and though ſhe fair appear,</l>
                  <l>Think, vice to virtue often comes too neer;</l>
                  <l>And in that errour (though it be an errour)</l>
                  <l>Preſerve thy ſelf from any further terrour.</l>
                  <l>If ſhe be round and plump, ſay ſhhe, too fat,</l>
                  <l>If brown, ſay black, and think who cares for that;</l>
                  <l>If ſhe be ſlender, ſwear ſhe is too lean</l>
                  <l>That ſuch a Wench will wear a man out clean;</l>
                  <l>If ſhe be red, ſay ſhe's to full of bloud;</l>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61669:46"/>
                  <l>If pale her body nor her mind is good;</l>
                  <l>If wanton ſay, ſhe ſeeks thee to devoure;</l>
                  <l>If grave, neglect her, ſay, she looks too ſowre.</l>
                  <l>Nay if she have a fault, and thou doſt know it,</l>
                  <l>Praiſe it, that in thy preſence she may show it</l>
                  <l>As if her voice be bad, crack'd in the ring,</l>
                  <l>Never give over till thou make her ſing.</l>
                  <l>If she have any blemish in herfoot,</l>
                  <l>Commend her dancing ſtill and put her to't.</l>
                  <l>If she be rude in ſpeech incite her talk;</l>
                  <l>If halting lame, provoke her much to walk.</l>
                  <l>Or if on inſtruments she have ſmall skill,</l>
                  <l>Reach down a Viall, urge her to that ſtill.</l>
                  <l>Take any way to eaſe thy own diſtreſſe,</l>
                  <l>And think thoſe faults be, which are nothing leſſe</l>
                  <l>Then meditate beſides, what thing it is</l>
                  <l>That makes thee ſtill in love to go amiſſe,</l>
                  <l>Adviſe thee Well, for as the world now goes</l>
                  <l>Men are not caught with ſubſtance but with ſhows;</l>
                  <l>Women are in their bodies turn'd to French,</l>
                  <l>That face and body's leaſt part of a wench.</l>
                  <l>I know a woman hath in love been troubled</l>
                  <l>For that which Taylors make a fine near Doublet,</l>
                  <l>And men are even as mad in their deſiring.</l>
                  <l>That oftentimes love Women for their tyring;</l>
                  <l>He that doth ſo, let him take this advice,</l>
                  <l>Let him riſe early, and not being nice,</l>
                  <l>Up to his Miſtris chamber let him hie,</l>
                  <l>E're ſhe ariſe, and there he shall eſpie</l>
                  <l>Such a confuſion of diſorderd things,</l>
                  <l>In Bodies, Iewels, Tyres, Wyres, Lawns, and Rings,</l>
                  <l>That ſure it cannot chuſe but much abhor him,</l>
                  <l>To ſee her ly in pieces thus before him;</l>
                  <l>And find thoſe things shut in a painted box</l>
                  <l>For which he loves her, and endures her mocks.</l>
                  <l>Once I my ſelf had a great mind to ſee</l>
                  <l>What kind of things Women undreſſed be,</l>
                  <l>And found my ſweet hart, juſt when I came at her,</l>
                  <l>Screwing her teeth, and dipping rags in water;</l>
                  <l>Shee miſs'd her perriwig, and durſt not ſtay,</l>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61669:46"/>
                  <l>But put it on in haſte the backward way;</l>
                  <l>That had I not on th 'ſuddain chang'd my mind,</l>
                  <l>I had miſtook and kis'd my Love behind.</l>
                  <l>So, if thou wiſh her faults ſhould rid thy cares,</l>
                  <l>Watch out thy time, and take her unawares:</l>
                  <l>Or rather put the better way in proof,</l>
                  <l>Come thou not neer, but keep thy ſelf aloof.</l>
                  <l>If all this ſerve not, uſe one medicine more,</l>
                  <l>Seek out another Love, and her adore;</l>
                  <l>But chuſe out one, in whom thou well maiſt ſee</l>
                  <l>A heart inclin'd to love and cheriſh thee.</l>
                  <l>For as a River parted flower goes,</l>
                  <l>So, Love thus parted ſtill more evenly flowes.</l>
                  <l>One Anchor will not ſerve a Veſſal tall,</l>
                  <l>Nor is one book enough to fiſh withall,</l>
                  <l>He that can ſolace him, and ſport with two,</l>
                  <l>May in the end triumph as others do.</l>
                  <l>Thou that to one hath ſhew'd thy ſelf too kind,</l>
                  <l>Maieſt in the ſecond much more comfort find:</l>
                  <l>If one Love entertain thee with deſpight,</l>
                  <l>The other will embrace thee with delight:</l>
                  <l>When by the former thou art made accurſt,</l>
                  <l>The ſecond will contend t'excel the firſt,</l>
                  <l>And ſtrive, with love, to drive her from thy breaſt:</l>
                  <l>("That firſt to ſecond yields, women, know beſt,</l>
                  <l>Or if to yield to either thou art loath,</l>
                  <l>This may perhaps acquit them of them both,</l>
                  <l>For what one love makes odd, two ſhall make even,</l>
                  <l>Thus blows with blows, and fire with fire's out driven.</l>
                  <l>Perchance this courſe will turn thy firſt loves heart,</l>
                  <l>And when thine is at eaſe cauſe hers to ſmart.</l>
                  <l>If thy loves rival ſtick ſo nere thy ſide,</l>
                  <l>Think, women can Copartners worſe abide.</l>
                  <l>For though thy Miſtriſs never mean to love thee,</l>
                  <l>Yet from the others love ſhe'l ſtrive to move thee?</l>
                  <l>But let her ſtrive, ſhe of chath vex'd thy heart,</l>
                  <l>Suffer her now to bear her ſelf a part,</l>
                  <l>And though thy bowels burn like <hi>Aema's</hi> fire,</l>
                  <l>Seem colder far then Ice, or her deſire;</l>
                  <l>Faign thy ſelf free, and ſigh not over much,</l>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61669:47"/>
                  <l>But laugh when ſadly grief thy heart doth touch,</l>
                  <l>I do not bid the break through fire and flame,</l>
                  <l>Such violence in love is much to blame,</l>
                  <l>But I adviſe, that thou diſſemble deep,</l>
                  <l>And all thy paſſions in thine own breaſt keep.</l>
                  <l>Faigne thy ſelf well, and thou at laſt shalt ſee</l>
                  <l>Thy ſelf as well as thou didſt faigne to be.</l>
                  <l>So have I often, When I would not drink,</l>
                  <l>Sate down as one a ſleep and faign'd to wink,</l>
                  <l>Till, as I nodding ſate, and took no heed,</l>
                  <l>I have at laſt faln faſt a ſleep indeed.</l>
                  <l>So have I oft been angry, faigning ſnight,</l>
                  <l>And counterfeiting ſmiles have laught outright.</l>
                  <l>So love, by uſe doth come, by uſe doth go,</l>
                  <l>And he that faignes well shall at length be ſo.</l>
                  <l>If ere thy Miſtriſs promis'd to receive thee</l>
                  <l>Into her boſome and did then deceive thee,</l>
                  <l>Locking thy rival in, thee out of door,</l>
                  <l>Be not deiected, ſeem not to deplore,</l>
                  <l>Nor when thou ſeeſt her next take notice of it,</l>
                  <l>But paſſe it over, it shall turn to profit:</l>
                  <l>For if she ſees ſuch tricks as theſe perplex thee,</l>
                  <l>She will be proud, and take delight to vexe thee.</l>
                  <l>But if she prove thee conſtant in this kind,</l>
                  <l>She will begin at length ſome ſleights to find,</l>
                  <l>How she may draw the back, and keep the ſtill</l>
